# Kingdom of Souls

## Introduction:

Our project, called Kingdom of Souls, is a turn-based roleplay game (RPG) with pixel graphics. The focus of the game is on the combat system. It should be as unique as possible. The opponents have a shield that can be destroyed with various physical and magical attacks. If the shield is broken, the enemy is stunned, takes a lot more damage and is no longer immune to any attacks. As a player you have a party of up to 7 members, but only 4 can be seen on the field. The rest of them sit on the "bench" that can be exchanged at will. Combo attacks are possible with any character. Each member has a “soul bar” which is refilled after each move, and when it is completely refilled, you can perform a reinforced move. The opponents are met by chance in the open game world, which contains many puzzles and dungeons. The game takes place in the Middle Ages. The world includes a large kingdom and outside of the infrastructure there are many small villages and dark dungeons.

## Initial Situation:

Pixel RPGs are very rare these days. However, there is a large fan base for these types of games. If you combine that with the unique game elements of our RPG, you get a game that will appeal to the RPG community. Many RPGs nowadays have the problem that they are too simple and not demanding enough from their players, which can more or less ruin an actually good game. We're trying to do exactly the opposite, as we find that harder games are mostly more fun. Another problem is that many RPGs are very long, which can work with a good story, but often prevents newer players from playing a game. Our game will focus on the battles for the most part so that less experienced RPG players don't get bored.

## General Conditions and Constraints:

The game and it's story is still in planning

No professionality, that means we don't have: musicians, sound and graphic designers, knowledge in Unity and no voice actors.

## Project Objectives and System Concepts:

The game has a unique battle system: 

* Enemies have a shield, you can break with either a physical or a magic attack. After it broke the enemy is stunned, takes more damage and he loses his immunities.
* Every character has a soulbar, that increases every turn they do an action. After it filled you can use an empowered move.
* Combo attacks are also available in thebattle system. A combo attack is a possible with every team member, however, the higher the friendship with a certain character is, the more powerful the combo attack becomes.

An explanation of the battle system is available, which you can skip.

The game features an explorable open world which contains many different puzzles, dungeons and obstacles to overcome.

Beautiful pixel graphics with fitting background music.

And a good story.

## Opportunities and Risks:

The difficulty of the game can lead to people not buying it, because they are beginners when it comes to RPG's.

The gameplay and the story might be not long enough for players.

## Planning:

Milestones:

1. Battlesystem:
    + Character and enemy sprites
    + Menu for the battle (Fight, Switch, Run, Bag)
    + Create stats
    + Better lvl = better stats
    + Soulbar
    + Advanced battlesystem (enemy shield, immunity, types, combo attacks)
    + Equipment for every character

2. Adding structures and more sprites to our game

3. Create the map and story
    + Story script
    + A starttown, when you first play the game
    + Many many villages
    + A kingdom
    + Dungeons
    + Mysteries and puzzles

4. Sounds and BGM's

The project will start now and end near the end of the school year.

The first prototype will be tested, after the battle system is fully done.

The big blocks of work would be programming the battle system, pixelating sprites and graphics, write a script, creating the world, making sounds and backgroundmusic.

In our opinion, there is no way to do the game in the given period of time, due to school itself.
