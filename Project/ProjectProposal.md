# Kingdom of Souls

## Introduction:

Our project, called Kingdom of Souls, is a turn-based roleplay game (RPG) with pixel graphics. The focus of the game is on the combat system. It should be as unique as possible. The opponents have a shield that can be destroyed with various physical and magical attacks. If the shield is broken, the enemy is stunned, takes a lot more damage and is no longer immune to any attacks. As a player you have a party of up to 7 members, but only 4 can be seen on the field. The rest of them sit on the "bench" that can be exchanged at will. Combo attacks are possible with any character. Each member has a “soul bar” which fills after each move, and when it is completely refilled, you can perform a reinforced move. The opponents are met by chance in the open game world, which contains many puzzles and dungeons. After every battle all characters in your party get XP and can level up when the XP bar fully filled. The game takes place in the Middle Ages. The world includes a large kingdom and outside of the infrastructure there are many small villages and dark dungeons. We want to publish it on the PC and the game is played in singleplayer mode.

## Initial Situation:

Pixel RPGs are very rare these days. However, there is a large fan base for these types of games. Many RPGs fall into the problem of being too easy and simple. Instead of smashing the attack button, RPGs key for battles should always be the strategic thinking and preperation before battles. 

## General Conditions and Constraints:

The game and it's story is still in planning.

No professionality, that means we don't have: musicians, sound and graphic designers, knowledge in Unity and no voice actors. 

But we have basic knowledge in the programming language C#.

## Project Objectives and System Concepts:

Our game will focus on the battles for the most part so that less experienced RPG players don't get bored.

The game has a unique battle system: 

Enemies have a shield, you can break with either a physical or a magic attack. After it broke the enemy is stunned, takes more damage and he loses his immunities.
Every character has a soulbar, that increases every turn they do an action. After it filled you can use an empowered move.
Combo attacks are also available in thebattle system. A combo attack is a possible with every team member, however, the higher the friendship with a certain character is, the more powerful the combo attack becomes.

The game is gonna be difficult, because the shields will make the enemies a lot harder, because you need strategic thinking, with which character you have to fight in order to break it. 

An explanation of the battle system is available, which you can skip.

The game features an explorable open world which contains many different puzzles, dungeons and obstacles to overcome.

Beautiful pixel graphics with fitting background music.

And a good story.

## Opportunities and Risks:

The difficulty of the game can lead to people not buying it, because they are beginners when it comes to RPG's.

The gameplay and the story might be not long enough for players.

## Planning:

Milestones:

Writing a part of the story 12.11.21
Creating sketches for the most important characters of the game 26.11.21
Creating sketches for map, that includes cities, dungeons, puzzles etc. 10.12.21
Programming the first prototype of the battlesystem 21.01.21
Creating the first overworld areas/maps of the game 18.01.21 



The project will start now and end near the end of the school year.

The big blocks of work would be programming the battle system, pixelating sprites and graphics, write a script, creating the world, making sounds and backgroundmusic.

In our opinion, there is no way to do the game in the given period of time, due to school itself.
