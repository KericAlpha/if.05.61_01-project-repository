# Kingdom of Souls

## Introduction:

Our project, called Kingdom of Souls, is a turn-based roleplay game (RPG) with pixel graphics. The focus of the game is on the combat system. It should be as unique as possible. The opponents have a shield that can be destroyed with various physical and magical attacks. If the shield is broken, the enemy is stunned, takes a lot more damage and is no longer immune to any attacks. The player has a party of up to 7 members, which can be controlled in battle, but only 4 can be seen on the field. The rest of them sit on the "bench" that can be exchanged at will. Combo attacks are possible with any character. Each member has a “soul bar” which fills after each move, and when it is completely refilled, a reinforced move can be performed. The opponents are met by chance in the open game world, which contains many puzzles and dungeons. After every battle all characters in the party get XP and can level up when the XP bar fully filled. Leveling up can increase all stats and therefore make the character stronger. The game takes place in the Middle Ages. The world includes a large kingdom and outside of the infrastructure there are many small villages and dark dungeons. We want to publish it on the PC and the game is played in singleplayer mode.

## Initial Situation:

Pixel RPGs are very rare these days. However, there is a large fan base for these types of games, because many people, especially older gamers like the old "restricted" artstyle, which led to many iconic creations. 


Many modern RPGs fall into the problem of being too easy and simple. Instead of smashing the attack button, RPGs key for battles should always be the strategic thinking and preperation before battles. 

## General Conditions and Constraints:

The game and it's story is still in planning.

No professionality, that means we don't have: musicians, sound and graphic designers, knowledge in Unity and no voice actors. 

But we have basic knowledge in the programming language C#.

## Project Objectives and System Concepts:

Our game will focus on the battles for the most part so that less experienced RPG players don't get bored.

The game has a unique battle system: 

Enemies have a shield, which can be broken with either a physical or a magic attack. After it broke the enemy is stunned, takes more damage and he loses his immunities.
Every character has a soulbar, that increases every turn they do an action. After it has been filled the character gains access to an empowered move, which can be used one time. After that, the soul bar resets to zero again.
Combo attacks are also available in thebattle system. A combo attack is a possible with every team member, however, the higher the friendship with a certain character is, the more powerful the combo attack becomes.

The shields will make the enemies a lot harder, because the player needs strategic thinking, with which character they have to fight in order to break it. This will add a lot of challenge to the game.

An explanation of the battle system is available, which can be skipped.

The game features an explorable open world which contains many different puzzles, dungeons and obstacles to overcome.

Beautiful pixel graphics with fitting background music.

And a good story.

## Opportunities and Risks:

The difficulty of the game can lead to people not buying it, because they are beginners when it comes to RPG's. However it can also lead to more dedicated fans liking the game.

The gameplay and the story might be not long enough for players.

Some of the sprites and textures might not look that good, becuase of our current skill level.

Because of schoolwork and the high learning curve, we might not reach our goals in time.


## Planning:

Milestones:

Writing a part of the story 12.11.21

Creating sketches for the UI in battle and outside of the battle 19.11.21

Creating sketches for the most important characters of the game 26.11.21

Creating sketches for map, that includes cities, dungeons, puzzles etc. 17.12.21

Programming the first prototype of the battlesystem 21.01.21

Creating the first overworld areas/maps of the game 18.01.21 

The project will start now and end near the end of the school year.

The big blocks of work would be programming the battle system, pixelating sprites and graphics, write a script, creating the world, making sounds and backgroundmusic.
